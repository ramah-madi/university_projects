In HSV, it is more easier to represent a color than in BGR color-space. In our application, we will try to extract a blue colored object.|

By using cvtColor function. 2.  By using imread function, where the first parameter specifies the image name while the second parameter specifies the format in which we need to add the image. |

### Image Manipulation and Processing
### ([Return back to Contents](#Contents))
In this section we are going to see how we are going to manipulate the image using OpenCV. Here we will learn to apply the following function on an image using OpenCV: (1) Image Transformations – Affine and Non-Affine Transformation (2) Image Translations – Moving image up, down, left and right (3) Rotation of image – Spinning the image (4) Scaling, Resizing, and Interpolation (5) Image Pyramids – Another way of resizing (6) Cropping – Cutting out the image region you want (7) Arithmetic operations for Brightening and Darkening of images
